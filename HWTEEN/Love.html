												<h3>Family</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We always say that family is the one who loves us the most; therefore, they will do anything to protect us, even under the condition that may be harmful to them. Take those two novels we read as examples.</p>
											<ul>
													<li>Bod and his birth mother (she asks the ghosts in the graveyard to protect and take care of Bod)</li>
													<li>Meg and Charles (she brings Charles back with all her love)</li>

												<h3>Friend</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Accompany each other to conquer the difficulties and influence each other to get better in lives. "At home one depends on his parents; abroad, he needs the help of his friends." Friends are indispensable in men's lives because they will help a lot in one's life. Just like the main characters in the stories, they encounter some problems but finally, their friends will help them to solve them. </p>
												<ul>
													<li>Bod and Liza (he is kidnapped by the pawnshop owner, and she helps him escape)</li>
													<li>Meg and Calvin (when she doubts herself, he helps her find her own value)</li>

												<h3>Guardian</h3>
											</header>
											<p>They point out the directions that main characters should go and assist them to find themselves. In real life, we also have guardians or teachers who play vital roles when we donâ€™t know what to do or which way to go. Those guardians teach, guide, and protect us as if they are our second parents.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Mrs. Who Whatsit Which</li>
